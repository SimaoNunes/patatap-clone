# patatap-clone

This is one of my first projects that I've developed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. \
The purpose was to clone [this](https://patatap.com) web animation site. \
It was a project from [this](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) online course that I highly recommend you to check out, if you are giving the first steps in Web Development.

## Start the game

Access the animation through [this](http://web.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/~ist186512/projects/patatap-clone/) link or download the repo.
If you downloaded the repo, make sure that there is a browser installed on your computer and start the animation by running the HTML file with it.

## Intructions
After opening the animation, press the letters of your keyboard.
